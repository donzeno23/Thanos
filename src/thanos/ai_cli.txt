@workspace how to fix this error: (.venv) Rachels-MacBook-Pro:thanos racheldaloia$ thanos
Traceback (most recent call last):

from thanos.cli import main
ImportError: cannot import name 'main' from 'thanos.cli' (/Users/racheldaloia/sandbox/Thanos/src/thanos/cli/init.py)


Context
The error indicates that the main function cannot be imported from thanos.cli. Looking at your project structure, I can see the issue:

You have a thanos.cli module (directory with __init__.py)

But your main function is defined in src/thanos/cli.py (a file)

The pyproject.toml script entry point is trying to import from the wrong location

Let me check the current CLI structure:


1 file read
The issue is clear now. You have two CLI-related items:

/src/thanos/cli.py (file) - contains your main function

/src/thanos/cli/ (directory) - contains __init__.py and runner.py

The pyproject.toml script entry point thanos = "thanos.cli:main" is trying to import from the directory, not the file.

Here are two ways to fix this:

Option 1: Move main function to the CLI package (Recommended)
Moving the main CLI function to the proper CLI package location

__init__.py

Undo
Now let's remove the old CLI file to avoid confusion:

Removing the old CLI file since we moved the functionality to the CLI package

Completed
rm src/thanos/cli.py
Now let's test the CLI:

Testing the CLI command to see if the import error is fixed

TypeError: Attempted to convert a callback into a command twice.

There's an issue with the Click decorators - we have the same run function decorated for both perf and performance groups. Let me fix this:

Now let's test the CLI again:

Testing the CLI command again after fixing the decorator issue

shell

Completed
cd /Users/racheldaloia/sandbox/Thanos && source .venv/bin/activate && thanos --help

Usage: thanos [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Thanos - A test framework for orchestrating stage workflows

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  basic        Basic testing commands
  perf         Performance testing commands
  performance  Performance testing commands (alias for perf)

Great! The CLI is now working. Let's test the subcommands:

Testing the performance subcommand to see available options

shell

Completed
cd /Users/racheldaloia/sandbox/Thanos && source .venv/bin/activate && thanos perf --help

Usage: thanos perf [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Performance testing commands

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  run  Run performance tests
Testing the basic subcommand to see available options

shell

Completed
cd /Users/racheldaloia/sandbox/Thanos && source .venv/bin/activate && thanos basic --help

Usage: thanos basic [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Basic testing commands

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  run-basic  Run basic tests
Perfect! The CLI is now working correctly. Here's a summary of what was fixed:

The Problem
The error occurred because:

Your pyproject.toml had thanos = "thanos.cli:main"

But you had both a cli.py file AND a cli/ directory

Python was trying to import main from the cli/ package, but it was defined in the cli.py file

The Solution
Moved the CLI functionality from src/thanos/cli.py to src/thanos/cli/__init__.py

Fixed Click decorator conflicts by giving unique function names (run, run_perf, run_basic)

Removed the old CLI file to avoid confusion

Your CLI Commands Now Work:
thanos --help - Shows main help

thanos perf run - Runs performance tests

thanos performance run - Alias for performance tests

thanos basic run-basic - Runs basic tests

The CLI structure is now properly organized with the main entry point in the CLI package where it should be.
